## Summary
Lecturer in Computer Science specialising in computational imaging, biomedical signal processing, and machine learning for digital health. My research targets non-invasive detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative disease, with a particular emphasis on Alzheimer’s disease using data-driven microwave imaging. I completed my PhD at the University of Edinburgh in collaboration with clinical neuroscientists, developing imaging pipelines for translational healthcare applications. I have teaching and research experience across multiple UK institutions (the University of Essex, South Wales, and Edinburgh) and I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, with publications in international journals and conferences.
