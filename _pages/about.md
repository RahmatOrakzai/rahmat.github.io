I am a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Essex and a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). My research focuses on artificial intelligence and computational imaging for digital health, with particular emphasis on non-invasive monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease using microwave sensing technologies.

I completed my PhD at the University of Edinburgh in collaboration with clinical neuroscientists, where I developed data-driven imaging pipelines for translational healthcare applications. My work integrates machine learning, biomedical signal processing, and sensing technologies to advance early diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions.

I have academic and research experience across institutions including the University of Essex, the University of South Wales, and the University of Edinburgh. I contribute to interdisciplinary research initiatives in digital health, intelligent healthcare systems, and assistive technologies, and have published in leading international journals and conferences.
