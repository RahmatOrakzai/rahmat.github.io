I am a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Essex and a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). My research focuses on artificial intelligence and computational imaging for digital health, with particular emphasis on non-invasive monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease using microwave sensing technologies.

I completed my PhD at the University of Edinburgh in collaboration with clinical neuroscientists, where I developed data-driven imaging pipelines for translational healthcare applications. My work integrates machine learning, biomedical signal processing, and sensing technologies to advance early diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions.
